## Ready For Dev

* Support Leader Capture mechanic
* Support Kwizatz Haderach
* Support Special Treachery Cards
* Support ANY TIME Karama powers
* Show battle round state
  * What leaders have been used
  * What battle powers have been "karamed"
  * What has been voiced
  * What has been prescienced
* Improve widgets for battle round
  * Battle Plan Selection
  * Voice Selection
  * Prescience Selection

## In Progress


## Done
* Show the discard piles on the board
* Switch to using websockets instead of polling
* Re-do BG coexist in a reasonable way
  * There shouldn't be any union arg specs with "coexist" constants, rather a Â¿coexist? check command should happen before the movement resolves
    * This check happens when you move from a coexist into an occupied territory where you do not already have fighthers
    * This check happens when someone else moves into a territory you were the sole occupier of
  * There shouldn't be a coexist persist option but rather the option to flip at any time before shipments occur
* Break up the Unions

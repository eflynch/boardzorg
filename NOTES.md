# Notes to myself #

  * Maybe should get rid of command parsing in Actions and implement a more strict argument pattern
  * Maybe should change how Action registration works
  * Maybe should add a "StageState" to the "RoundState" with an optional ck_stage check
  * Maybe should change raise InvalidAction to return False
  * Maybe should change raise BadCommand to raise InvalidAction
  * Maybe should change the representation of units
  * Maybe should switch to functional interface for state so that representation can change? (I think the overhead is  as bad either way though)

# Notes to myself #

  * Maybe should get rid of command parsing in Actions and implement a more strict argument pattern
  * Maybe should change how Action registration works
  * Maybe should add a "StageState" to the "RoundState" with an optional ck_stage check
  * Maybe should change raise InvalidAction to return False
  * Maybe should change raise BadCommand to raise InvalidAction


## Active TODO ##

  * Refactoring imports
